# **Tableau Project Arsenal FC 2018-2019 Stats**

This makeovermonday challenge with data.world was to see the comparison of each player on the Arsenal FC 2018-2019 roster in each category of soccer provided by data.world. Created SQL queries to take a more depth analysis of the data to see if there are any deficiencies or biases that may be present. Inferred that minutes played are skewed towards goalkeepers since this position is rarely substituted in a game. Another inference is passes and touches are skewed favorably for players who are midfielders or forwards.
